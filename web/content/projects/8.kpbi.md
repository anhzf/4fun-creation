The system is built using Laravel for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. The backend is Restful API that powers the frontend. The API is authenticated using a session. The frontend is built using Quasar Framework, a Vue.js framework that allows building a single codebase for multiple platforms with beautiful Material Design components.

The system is built to help KPBI to manage their members. The system can generate membership cards and manage the membership period with a billing system. The system also has a dashboard that shows the list of members, the list of active members, and the list of inactive members.

The system is deployed on the organization's server and is accessible at [anggota.kpbi.or.id](https://anggota.kpbi.or.id). The CI/CD pipeline is also configured in GitHub Actions.
