## Processes

### How it works
ORMNicro is a device that processes organic waste using EM4. The device is connected to the internet and sends data to the firebase realtime database. The mobile application is used to monitor multiple devices.

As it uses Firebase, the mobile application can receive real-time data from the devices. The application also allows the user to manage their devices and users.

There are two types of monitoring for each devices, the composter and maggot bin. The composter monitoring shows the temperature, humidity, and weight of the compost. The maggot bin monitoring shows the temperature, humidity, and weight of the maggot bin.

### The Prototype
The prototype is designed using Figma. The prototype is designed to be simple and easy to use.
