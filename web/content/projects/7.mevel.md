## The Idea
We're trying to reach unpopular but beautiful destination. Powering the strength of human socialization to introduce a new destination with their stories. The matchmaking feature gather the traveler from any origins, besides from having fun it potentially to get ticket discounts and/or cheaper accommodation prices.

## Infrastructure Design

### Why Firebase?
Firebase ecosystem provided hands-on application needs, including back-end services, simple use of the SDKs, and ready-to-use infrastructures. The provided ecosystem satisfies us for prototyping purposes. Even with the simplicity, in terms of scalability, it also scales without limits (~pay-as-you-go~¬†as you have money). The serverless, SDK, pay-as-you-go schema, and the SLA make the effortless but way more efficient (performance and costs).

As part of the Google Cloud, it makes it easy to integrate with other Google Cloud services, which also means ease of project codebase and organization. Their rich services were also capable of the most cases. The cloud functions (Firebase and non-firebase) provide easy integration and serve as a small service for applications.

## Application UI
The design is following the [Material Design 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/) as they also provided the components for building the Android application to make the implementation easier.
