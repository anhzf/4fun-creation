## Responsibilities
Simply change the quiz platform from PPT slides to a web-based platform. The new quiz platform is designed to be child-friendly, interactive, and responsive. Also, the web platform aimed to be more automated by doing the analysis and generate the report.

I'm working on a team which consists of a project manager, a developer, and a graphic designer. As the developer, I'm responsible to guide the project manager defining the requirements into a technical specification and its implementations. The graphic designer gives us the guide for the design style of the quiz platform and provides the assets needed for the platform.

## Highlights
- **Performant for Best Experiences** - As the app is React.js-based, every detail optimization is done to ensure the best experience for the children.
- **Serverless Function for Report Generation** - The report generation is done using Firebase Cloud Functions to ensure the report is generated quickly and securely.
