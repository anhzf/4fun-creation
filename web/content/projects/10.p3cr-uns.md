Working with the Rector Candidate Selection and Screening Committee (P3CR) of Sebelas Maret University, I built a website that serves as a channel of information for the committee. The website is built using Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS, and the CMS is managed using Directus.

The website is deployed on the university's server and is accessible at [p3cr.uns.ac.id](https://p3cr.uns.ac.id). The CI/CD pipeline is also configured in the university's GitLab server.
